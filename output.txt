title: what do you wish the opposite gender would stop doing?
Ive got a 2 for 1Guys stop thi king all nice girls are flirting with you.Girls if youre flirting flirt harder than just being nice..
Everyone should stop putting the opposite sex against each other. Its ridiculous..
Making stereotypes about the opposite gender on social media.
If you like a guy just tell him and stop dropping hints that you think are obvious but most guys are oblivious to. For example my sister told me that she knew a family friends daughter had a crush on me because said daughter would walk past me often. I was like what the but she did actually wind up trying to go out with me..
I both sides could just stop raping people thatd be nice.
Stop breaking up with us to teach us a lesson and get us to see how life would be without you. A lot of the time it backfires..
abuse.
thinking they shouldnt have the initiative.
Blaming the opposite gender for their personal problems instead of taking responsibility..
Stop doing or saying things to signal youre interested in a long term relationship wheb in fact you have no intention of committing. If I have one more man tell me Im wonderful at being a girlfriend I make them unbelievably happy or that they like the idea of having a future with me while also taking me out on fancy dates but then turning around and saying Im not looking for a serious relationship. Im gonna freaking lose it. Just state your intentions from the beginning and stop sending confusing ass mixed signals..
Putting us on tests.
Running smear campaigns against someone to protect your reputation..
