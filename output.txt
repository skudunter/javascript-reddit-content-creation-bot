title: What hobby can someone have that raises an immediate red flag?

A lot of non-hobbies in here.

I work at a casino. Gambling is my answer.
I had a roommate in college who would "track" people. Just follow them around while they were on a walk or at the grocery store to watch what they did; never interacting, just watching. Never sat right with me at all.

Edit: Wow this blew up. A lot of people were asking, but no, wasn't stalking, because he only followed people in public spaces. I did wake up to him just watching me sleep a few times; that was.... uncomfortable. We had a decent relationship in spite of it, but didn't keep in touch after college.
People who like to find tiny and cramped caves to climb in and squeeze through. I am scared of you.
Filling the entirety of r/AskReddit with sexual questions and Male V.S. Female questions
Collecting serial killer memorabilia (Dahmers glasses, Gacyâ€™s paintings, etc.)
A lot of people don't seem to know what a hobby is.
Collecting the condoms of your sexual partners and making a scrap book based around the subject.  Yes I knew a girl who did this and she was a crackpot. No I was not in the scrapbook, but many friends were.
Dated a girl in high school that one day proudly proclaimed she finished my carving and showed me a wooden stick person with my name etched into the body. 

Broke up with her, and she sent me a video of the wooden me burning. Apparently, she did that with all her ex boyfriends.

So yeah, making wooden effigies became a red flag hobby for me.

EDIT: I should add we dated for 2 weeks total
Bull fighting tends to raise a lot of red flags
Putting mice organs inside transparent lego men
I'm pretty sure this question was asked just the other day.

Edit: yes, 3 days ago. Exact same wording too.

Dog show exhibitor. I'm half joking as it's a hobby I want to get into myself, but it's a world with some serious politics and immature, catty behavior.
