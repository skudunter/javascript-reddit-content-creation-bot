title: You borrowed $5 from a friend and played the lottery and won 80 million.. How much will you give your friend and why?

I'd probably give them a little holiday bonus, so $6
[removed]
I used his $5 to buy a drink. My $5 bought the ticket.
If I had $80 million I'd definitely toss my friend a million.
If I win $80 mil, which is around $50 mil after taxes off the money someone lent to me, I’d buy them almost whatever the fuck they wanted.
First, I'd never tell anyone that I won. 

I'd pay back the 5 bucks. 

Then a good amount of time later they'd receive an anonymous gift containing a cashier's check that would set them up for the rest of their lives. 

I wouldn't be able to sleep at night if I didn't do something significant for them.
A buddy once gave me $100 enter a poker tournament in Vegas. I was in Vegas for a work thing at a time in my life when money was very tight. He have me the $100 and told me to play in a poker tournament because it would take the evening, drinks are free and I could enjoy.

I wound up winning it! $2900

The next morning I went to bank and I deposited $2200, kept $200 for the 2nd night, and $500 for my friend who spotted me.

That night I had an epic 45 min roll at craps. It was fucking insane. I turned that $200 into $27,000.  

I tried to give him $5,000. I wanted him to have it for being such a bro.  He refused it said the $500 was great and I should enjoy.

This was 15 years ago.  Were still great friends.
I've actually experienced something similar to this, where I gave my brother money to buy one and he won a smaller prize, and I felt incredibly annoyed when he didn't give me any of it. It wasn't mine to have, and I was a lot younger

Problem is I can totally see that happening in this scenario, even if you gave them half it is possible they'd feel entitled to more. So honestly, I wouldn't tell them I had won and simply return the five bucks.

However, this is mostly a thought experiment so my real action might be completely different to this, who knows.
Pay back the $5 and nothing more. Once you pay back more, you are opening yourself up to a lawsuit on the basis that by paying back extra, you’re acknowledging the idea that the loaner has a piece of the action.  I’m not a lawyer but I stayed at a holiday inn last night.
I wouldn't borrow money from a friend just to play the lottery, because I'm not a shitty friend.
New phone, who dis?
I'd still have to pay back $5 if I lost, so $5
