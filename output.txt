title: People who worked at fraudulent companies like Enron and Theranos, what was your experience?
Second hand story. I worked with someone who was at WorldCom when it imploded. He said it was like a layoff it was sudden and unexpected. One day it was just all over. He talked about paper millionaires who were crying when the stock went to zero.You hear all these stories about people putting all their time energy and savings into a single bucket.. and it blowing up. Diversify...
My boss worked at Arthur Anderson and was an audit partner there during 200102. In my talks with him he had said the funny thing about companies that are caught for committing fraud is there has to be some sort of backbone of legitimate activity behind it for it to work be less traceable. In his time there he performed audits just the way he was educated to and went on his business. Its not like the entire company is corrupt and evil and there are certain people at the top that keep the good eggs out of their plans. Obviously he wasnt convicted of any wrongdoing when the company collapsed and he transferred to another public accounting firm as a partner soon thereafter..

title: What's an annoying myth that people still cling to?
That if you touch a baby bird its mother will abandon it because of the smell. Birds actually have a very crappy sense of smell. ETA yes I realize there are exceptions such as vultures that do have a good sense of smell...but in general smelling a human on their baby wont make them abandon them as far as I am aware..
That we only use 10 percent of our brain.
That carrots give you good eyesight.
An undercover cop has to tell you theyre a cop if you ask them..
That msg is bad for you.
Lightning never strikes twice in the same place..
That the earth is flat.
Almost all the weird things people believe about charging batteries is completely wrong they are based on Old NiCad cells and most of that advice does not apply to lithium ion  LiPO batteries.

That you need to wait 24 hours to file a missing persons report.
That companies cant say that you were fired or why you were fired by law..

title: Sheltered people raised by super religions/cults: what was something about the real world that shocked you when you learned about it?
Where is all the sex and drugs?! I was promised wanton lascivious fucking in the streets..
For me it was a complete culture shock. People could do anything . Women could treat men as equals not always defer to them. People treat other people with more respect adults are treated like adults. People could talk about sex and bodily functions like periods without being ashamed. People werent afraid of living their lives in a way that made them happy. In the first few months of being out of my parents home I learned so many new words and things I didnt know existed  I watched a lot of movies that would have been considered wickedly sinful in my former home. I had to relearn how to talk and act with people. Outside of the church people do everything different and the people you can and cant trust are different. I felt like I had the IQ of a normal 8 year old in the real world..
