title: On the first date, what were some immediate red flags that made you not go on a second date?
I went out for drinks with a guy who monologued the entire time. Could barely get a word in. The worst.
He told me he had worms. Not in a casting, fishing, or terrarium kind of way. Full on internal parasites.
She was still married and said she just wanted to know if she’d “be able to still get dates if they split up”… worst date ever
He was about 10 years older than his pictures,  he didn't stop twitching the entire time, and he kept pressuring me to go back to his place. I noped the fuck outta there.
She pulled out a switchblade mid conversation to slice up a passing ant.
He tried to change my order with the waitress because I didn’t order what he’d recommended.
He smelt bad. We were outside walking along an ocean break wall and I could smell him, yuck
[removed]
Date went fine but on drive back he got into a road rage . He starting blasting though red lights and speeding and yelling . I told him that I’m not putting my life in danger over a hissy-fit from a grown ass man. Nope
Went out with a girl who only talked about her ex-husband and his porn addiction. After listening for 2 hours about his Asian porn collection, I nope’d out of there hard!
Went out with a girl, we hit it off well to the point that things heated up and I spent the night at her place, only to wake up to an empty house and no clothes... She had taken ALL of my clothes, including my underwear, with her to work.
I went on a date with a guy who called himself a mama’s boy and said no woman would ever compare to his mother. There was no second date, and despite how many times I turned him down and said I wasn’t interested, he kept calling and texting me for two years until I changed my number
He stared at his phone the whole time. Then after we parted he sent a text complimenting my ass and then said we should go out again.
At dinner, he shared with me that he didn’t believe in washing his hands after going to the bathroom, as long as toilet paper was used effectively, “hand washing was obsolete”.

He said all of this while licking his fingers and digging into a shared basket of appetizers. I was disgusted. Lol
He brought his two year old along on our date. He then informed me he would be okay with me going out and partying for maybe one more year to “get it out of my system” but after that he expected me to settle down. Then went on a strange rant about how important it is for women to “have their fun” before becoming moms so they are ready to be homemakers. I was 19 and also was not aware he even had a kid beforehand.
It made me cancel the first date we had planned. I met a guy on a dating site and he asked me on a date and I agreed. Later, I got a call from work saying a package had been delivered. It was a huge bouquet of flowers. I was so confused. I asked him if he had sent them and he said “I did! You said you had a bad day last Friday so I wanted to make this Friday a good one for you.” Normally, I would absolutely love this gesture and be over the moon with this. The only problem is that I never told him where I worked and I had told him I lived in a large city an hour away to be on the safe side. So not only did he find my true town but also found out where I had worked. Instant red flag and made me terrified.

EDIT: I am not on Linkedin and never have been.
Met up with this guy from Tinder. After talking for a bit and having a coffee, he was like “want to meet my kid?” I felt totally put on the spot and although I was clearly uncomfortable, I panicked and said I would. We went back to his place and I met the kid, she was actually pretty cool. Then he sent her off to bed and proceeded to tell me that the mother of his child randomly dropped dead in their kitchen one day, and now his kid didn’t have a mom. I looked around his place and there were pictures of said dead mom everywhere.

I told him it was getting late and I was going to get going. Before I left he asked if he could stroke my stomach and pinch my ass. It was a very specific and super odd request. I said no. The next day he sent me a text asking me if I would babysit his kid. Not even asking me on a second date…just asking for child care.
Not entirely red flags but just some small world things that made that first date the last one. 

For context before the date, I picked him up. He was in a wheelchair. He lost his leg in a motorcycle accident a few years back and had recently had surgery on his leg because of bone spurs. He normally has a prosthetic. 

We went out for breakfast. Everything seemed fine, no major issues with him. When it came time to pay, his card was declined. He called his dad (who was also his boss) to figure out why his paycheck hadn’t been deposited. Conversation went back and forth and I ended up paying and he promised to pay me back. It totally wasn’t a big deal, it happens, I get it. 

So we get back to my car and he made a comment about the last time he was around a RAV4 it was his motorcycle accident. He hit into one that was pulling out of a restaurant and that’s when he lost his leg. For some reason that triggered a memory of a conversation I had with my mom a while back about my aunt who had the same car which was totaled during an accident. 

I was texting him and asked him a few more questions about the accident, where it happened and such. Long story short it was MY aunt who was driving the car that pulled out of the restaurant and he hit into. He was currently in the process of suing her because of it, despite the fact that he was going almost double the speed limit at the time and didn’t even have his license. Needless to say there was no second date (and he never did pay me back for breakfast).
Another great one, I went on a date with a Korean-American guy in college, it was really lovely. Until his mother called during our coffee date. She asked him what my name was and he told her, first and last. He got a sad look on his face and stood up, apologizing profusely for wasting my time. He said, "I am so sorry, I should have had her look you up before the date." Super confused I looked at him and asked, "What are you talking about?" Apparently he didn't realize my name was Japanese-American (I am biracial but white-passing) and his mother saw my Facebook pfp at the time was me and my family at the Obon Festival hosted by the Buddhist temple and Japanese-American society in my city. So he left the date because his mommy told him he couldn't date a Japanese girl.
pulled out a loaded gun in my car to try and impress me
I once went on a first date with a guy who was clearly not over his ex. He spent the entire time talking about her, comparing me to her, and even showing me pictures of them together. It was a huge red flag for me and made it clear that he wasn't ready for a new relationship. Needless to say, I didn't go on a second date with him.
She and I were sitting in a club when a guy she knew walked by and waved.  He said, "Hi, Kate! Haven't seen you in a while", and walked on.  She yelled after him, "Yeah, but do ya think about me when you JACK OFF?"  The whole club came to a record scratch halt and stared at her. Then, fearing the people on the street out front hadn't heard her, she repeated, "I SAID, 'Do ya THINK ABOUT ME when you JACK OFF'?"

I made it an early night.
1. Argued with me about my order at the steakhouse. I wanted my steak medium rare and he said it should be well done because looking at rare or raw meat makes him sick.  2. Tried to change my order with the waitress when I was in the bathroom. She checked with me before making the change because she heard us arguing. I took my medium rare steak to go.
Few years ago met up with a guy at a bar and like the entire time he would not stop talking about how he couldn’t wait to go to russia and get a mail-order-bride.
I went to the bar to get another drink, the bartender wrote a cd recommendation on a piece of paper for me. 
Guy says ‘Did you just give that guy your number?’ 
Me: ‘Nope, just swapped music recommendations’
Him: ‘I was going to knock his block off’
Me: ‘Wow you have kind of a bad temper, hey?’ 
Him: ‘Yeah, how’d you know? See these scars, it’s bc one time I was stuck in a traffic jam and I got so angry I **punched my fist through the windscreen**’ 

NOPE.
Explained everything to me like I had just arrived on the planet, explained how exchange rates work, explained how package holidays work, explained parking, explained that it’s cheaper to have roommates…learned so much lol
I once went out on a date with a guy off of gay.com and he asked to pick me up…which was fine. He picked me up and proceeded to road rage at everyone for ANYTHING. At one point, his head was out the window screaming profanities at family in a van, who not even slightly cut him off. I was so scared 😳
Met a stranger at the grocery store, and he asked me out for dinner. Dinner didn't go very well (he spent most of the date insulting me for being a vegetarian) and at the end of the night when we were walking back to our cars and saying bye, he asked if he could have a kiss. I said no. He asked again. I said no. He said how about a peck on the cheek, so I go to do that and he turns and kisses my mouth quickly. Definitely knew there would be no second date after that. I ignored all future texts. His last one said, "why does this always happen to me?"
Part 1: I was 24 years old. He came to the door to pick me up, and he was carrying something. It wasn’t flowers… it was a Bratz doll. An actual Bratz doll in the box, brand new, like he actually went to the store and made a conscious decision to buy it for 24-year-old me. He was 32. “I thought you’d like this,” he said. Dead serious. Did he want me to act younger? I don’t know, but he creeped me out. Whole date was weird. Part 2: The day after, he kept calling while I was at the grocery store, and I don’t like to talk on the phone while I’m shopping. I called him back (dumb). He asked why I was ignoring his calls and I told him the truth- that I had been shopping and I preferred to be able to interact with the people I needed to speak to (deli person, etc.) without being on the phone. He got upset and was mad/sad about how it wasn’t fair that the grocery store workers got that much of my time and attention, but he didn’t 😳 That was the end of that.
He called the waitress a "fucking stupid cunt" for forgetting that he wanted his shot chilled.
We met up at his place. He was making dinner for me. We were chatting on the couch when he stood up to excuse himself to the restroom. As he was walking away, he turned and mentioned the cameras all over his home so “don’t steal anything”, then he pointed to a stack of papers on an end table. “I believe in honesty. That’s my arrest record. Everything is right there.” He went on his way. I considered leaving right then, but didn’t. 

I did pick up that stack of papers. Holy shit. His arrest record was several pages long and spanned three states. Most of the arrests were for domestic violence. There were a couple involving weapons, some minor drug charges and assault charges. 

He returned and, thank god, my phone rang. I answered it even though I didn’t recognize the number, had no idea who it was. I made like it was one of my daughters and she needed to be picked up from somewhere immediately. I’ll never know who was actually on the other end of that call, but I left this guy’s home and never looked back. I will admit I casually ignored some red flags before our date. But the camera tale (I don’t believe for a minute he had cameras everywhere) and the criminal history wouldn’t allow me to ignore what I already felt.
Made multiple comments about my appearance, to be fair they were positive, but delivered in a very creepy and shallow way. He also told me about how he was arrested in front of his old apartment and then evicted. After I told him I did not wish to go on a second date he response was, “Okay, but first I really want to fuck your brains out.” THIS WAS A FIRST DATE AND I WAS 19! 
Some comments include: 


-“I bet you work out” 

-“I bet you look at the mirror and just think ‘Damn’” 
-etc.

-“if I were you I’d check myself out all the time”
I had coffee with someone I met off a dating app and he starts going on about how he has a domestic violence charge with his ex and began explaining how it wasn't his fault and they were abusing meth at the time. The more he explained, the worse it sounded. I thanked him for the coffee and said I had to get going. I got a message later that day from him saying, "I fucked that up, didn't I"? I didn't respond.
Date was doing lines of blow on the table in the club.
Was hanging out with this guy in a state park during the night, and out of nowhere he said "Don't you ever have the  urge to hurt people in very bad ways?"

It was even worse because I didn't know my way back to the dorm room, and he wasn't going to tell me so I can figure the way back by myself and to spend more time together (plus he stole my phone so I wouldnt check the Maps app). Imagine being with a guy in the middle of the night in a park where nobody is around you and suddenly you hear that lol. 

I can't believe how naive I can be sometimes when I fall for someone. I am so glad nothing bad happened.
I told her I had a dog…

She said “oh neat!  What breed?”

I told her, “Siberian Husky!”

“Oh!  A big dog!  At least she’ll die young so you can get a puppy again soon!”
One guy I reluctantly met up with once turned out to be a Nazi magician. He praised Hitler and denied the holocaust (that was the conversation he opened with), and said immigrants shouldn’t be allowed in the country anymore. This was bad enough without noting that I am an immigrant. And so was he. He then proceeded to bend a spoon “with his mind” and pressured me into solving an impossible riddle. All this in maybe an hour, which I had stayed for purely out of morbid curiosity. Then he said I wasn’t what he was looking for, because I was too cold to be the future mother of his children (yes, Nazi sympathizer, you are right, I felt very cold towards you). THEN he asked if I wanted to come home with him. I’m still in disbelief
I went on a date with a guy years ago we were in San Francisco walking around after an art show he just littered. I said oh there’s a trash can right over there and he just said so what and chuckled. Never saw that guy again lol.
Texting and answering a phone call in the middle of dinner, person on the phone asked what he was doing and he responded saying “not much”
Oh my god, not me but a friend had a guy pick her up in this car. He was a set builder, so he picked her up in this truck. So they go to dinner and he was twitching and acting really weird. Well when they left, HE HAD AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CAR??? Like went to a different car in the lot. 
I’ll have to ask her the story again because it was so insane but I’ll never forget him somehow having a bait car change in the middle of dinner.
He said "I love you" on the first date (we'd known eachother two days at this point), he also kept asking to see my bedroom which is just bad vibes on a first date. 

I ended it there cause he was moving way too fast and I was overwhelmed. He then proceeded to stalk me. He would message my best friends (WHO HE HAD NOT MET BUT SOMEHOW KNEW WERE REALLY CLOSE TO ME) asking to give him my number and saying how he missed me... (we literally had known eachother 2 days and went on one bad date... how could he miss me? He doesn't know me...) 

A year later I was at an anime convention with my new boyfriend, we were both cosplaying Dramatical Murder characters... guess who shows up to photobomb us, also wearing Dramatical Murder cosplay? Mr Red Flag himself!! 🚩  

My boyfriend knew who he was and when the photo was happening thought "I should kiss him or something to show we're together" but he was wearing a mask as part of the cosplay so in a panic he just grabbed my crotch! (Ironically that in any other scenario would be a red flag)

Yeah definitely dodged a bullet with that guy. I do sometimes wonder what on Earth the photographer thought was happening.
Met a guy on an app. Talked for a while. Met up for drinks and I was asking him about his Dexter tattoo (he had Michael C. Hall’s face on his shoulder) and he said that what he liked most about Dexter was that he hid his true identity. Needless to say, I never saw him again.
At a coffee shop, stared/eye undressed every single semi attractive women that came in, for the entire time they were there.

Also complained about how the nurses refused to entertain him during a recent hospital stay (which he also shared too much information about)
She was a single mom, went to pick her up, she invites me inside, her 2 kids, like 3 and 4 have a giant Mt dew in one hand, cigarette in the other.  I basically teleported back to my truck and broke the fuck out.
dude spent the whole date talking about how he used to sell cocaine
Showed me a video of him killing a rabbit with his bare hands. I used his bathroom an there was what I am fairly certain was a big gulp cup full of vomit on the side of the tub
He turned up 30 minutes late and was hammered… (drunk) then informed me that he drove to the date which was a 20 minute drive from where he had been.
He was incredibly rude to the waitress and stared at her ass (he wasn’t subtle about it either). Being rude to servers is an instant turn off.
Tried to show off his dumb honda by speeding recklessly through a residential neighborhood with me in the passenger seat. As soon as I was able to calmly get him to stop driving, I got out and walked myself to a Wawa and waited for a friend to pick me up. What a tool.
showing me his boner
Talking to her imaginary friend. Her friend was a great conversationalist. As for her, no way, dull and as interesting as a door knob.
His lunch was absolutely all over his face and hands. Everywhere. He also got up THRICE from the table to go to the bathroom but came back messy each time.
When the gal I was taking out on first date explicitly said, I expect anyone I date to buy me things. Not like flowers, but go to the mall and literally buy her all sorts of stuff. And get this, she was a psychologist. I shudder to think of someone using her in her professional capacity. I have had a second gal I dated for a couple months, so not a first date, that was similar to this one. 4 months in she tells me she won't be with anyone who makes less than $100K (this was about 2009 so inflation she is probably at $150k). Could not believe my ears. I was a scientist so I said, if we were married, and I lost my biotech job and took an academic position as a professor, but made $75k, you would leave me? Yes was her response. Dumped her that day.
He wanted to know where I lived, my exact address. And he wouldn’t drop it when I gave him general answers.
Old worn out t-shirt.   
Sweaty. Brought his dog along. The dog wouldn't look at me when I tried to make friends, only looked at his master. 

He was a cell phone tower tech. Decided he could psychoanalyze me. Told me I'm afraid of men, despite me meeting him in a state park. Told me he's tired of having steak dinners and ice cream and still not getting a relationship out of it, so from now on, he's going for sex first. Told me I have a lot to think about. Nope, dude, didn't have to think it over at all. 

His profile said he didn't like organized religion. On our date he told me he belonged to some religious faith following a guru, Osho, in India. And he went to India a couple of times. Then he told me his wife passed away 6 weeks ago. He asked if he could call me, I said yes, thinking you can call, I'm not going to answer. He never called, LOL.
Reading this post gives me an ego boost because holy shit people like this actually exist.
I tried joining in on his conversation about Marvel comic books or some bullshit and he started quizzing me on my comic book knowledge and insisting on explaining lore that I already knew. Sooo you didn’t want a conversation you just wanted to dump this information on me? Cool
He invited his brother. And after many times of telling him I was under age ( for drinking) kept trying to get me to go drink with them. We did go pants shopping for his brother though.
One date in particular comes to mind. This guy I knew through a mutual friend kept asking if he could take me for dinner, I always politely turned him down because I'd just come out of a relationship and wasn't looking to jump into another, but my friend convinced me that "I should try and get back out there and enjoy myself". The next time I ran into him he asked if he could take me out again, so I relented and agreed.

The date went fine for the most part, a few awkward moments here and there but nothing that made me want to call it a night. Then we get to the bill, he paid on his card and then told me "Don't worry I've got you covered, you can pay me back for your half when we get back to my place" and made a winking gesture at me. Needless to say there was no second date, and he made the journey back to his place alone.
So when I picked her up, she was still doing chores on her farm. And didn’t want to freshen up before we left so she smelled like a barn but I put it aside…
At dinner she casually mentions stabbing her brother.
Then at the movie it comes up she stabbed an ex boyfriend.

There was not a second date
He told me he had not been allowed to see his kids due to claims of alleged SA. Pretty positive they don't take visits away without some sort of corroboration. Also, we met online and it seemed as tho he found a random pic online and used it for his profile. It was clearly not him. I escaped as quickly as I could... One other guy told me he loved me before the end of the 1st date 🤦‍♀️
In the same vein but not exact - I had to cancel on a first date for getting food poisoning about an hour before the date. Dude started *screaming* at me for being disrespectful and whatnot. He actually tried to reschedule. I declined. Immediately.
She talked about her father for thirty minutes, who left her mother twenty years ago. It felt like I was her therapist.
Wanted to move in together.
Showed up and my door, told me I looked cute in my dress but it was too sexy (spoiler, it really wasn’t) &amp; I was never allowed to wear it again. 

Literally only went on the date &amp; didn’t slam the door in his face because we lived on a cruise ship together! It’s not safe to have a stalker in close quarters. I just acted like a complete dud on our date &amp; he never asked me out again.
There was one date that stands out as the worst of all, but in retrospect it's kind of funny. 

I met this guy online and we had a few conversations before deciding to meet up. He seemed nice and normal, but when he showed up to the date he was wearing a full-on costume. He had dressed up as a superhero, complete with a mask and a cape. 

I was completely caught off guard and didn't know how to react. I tried to go along with it and make the best of it, but it was just too weird. 

I never saw him again, and I don't think I ever will.
First date a woman opens her laptop and shows me a video of her giving “natural child birth” in a pool with her ex. Then the now 7 year old kid comes out to watch and was like “oh, I love this video!” In other words, I’m not the first guy she’s made watch this. No second date 😂
Told him I wasn’t comfortable fucking on the first day without a condom so he left me on the side of the road. Just stopped the car on the way to the restaurant and told me to get out.
Ordered a bunch of food without asking what I wanted (I didn’t want nearly that much food, and also have some allergies so couldn’t eat half of it) then when the check came he said casually, well I don’t want to be a JEW about it… and then asked if we could split it in half. After recovering from shock I told him I was Jewish. 

Side note, I’m still confused. If he didn’t want to be a Jew, the stereotype is Jews are greedy, so shouldn’t he have offered to pay?? I dunno, maybe I’m just still bitter about paying for half of that bullshit.

Anyway, gotta love dating in North Carolina.
I fell asleep during the first date. It was summertime and super muggy out. We got tea and he wanted to sit outside in the sun. He kept going on about engineering and couldn’t take the cue/I couldn’t cut in. Next thing I knew, I had dozed off. I have no idea how long. But I was sweaty and warm and bored. The weird thing is that he kept talking……..
We had great evening and ended up getting drunk together and singing karaoke. She tricked me into showing her a ring I had inherited from family. Somehow being drunk and merry I completely fucked up and did not realize she had kept it and then made fast excuse she needs to go get something or something and just left having stolen it. It turns out she lied about even being from my city. Never seen her since.
He ordered for me, served me a single tiny slice of wood fired pizza that DID not fill me up, and then before I could ask for a second slice, packed it up and put it in the back of his car. 

I excused myself to call a friend to come pick me up because I absolutely would not let this man know where I lived. 

It's been almost 2 years. I'm STILL salty about not having more of that pizza.
I met this guy in a public park (from a dating app) who was an unemployed military vet and clearly had some mental issues. These weren’t super apparent when texting. As soon as we sat down to chat he told me about his current crap living situation and asked if he could move in with me and my kids, offered to watch them for me while I worked and then got mad when I immediately declined since I didn’t really know him and we JUST MET. I was so annoyed that he even thought that was okay to ask as I’m a very protective momma. The whole time he was very pushy and upset when I wasn’t just going along with whatever plans he already had in his head for us. Near the end of the meeting he could tell things weren’t going in his favor and asked if I had intentions of even dating him and I told him outright, NO. He again got mad and just left. Not long after that I got a message from him saying he wasted his gas coming to meet me and I could have at least had sex with him. Apparently I owed him something since I wouldn’t provide him with shelter and financial support.
This ALL happened during our first (and last) date. It literally kept getting worse one after the other:

When they brought the food, he immediately asked them to remake it as it's not cooked exactly how he wanted. And then he ALSO returned the remade one and just ordered something else... Red flag

His phone suddenly lit up and I see a picture of 2 young girls. Asked if they were his niece and he said it's his 2 year old and 4 year old daughter (which he never mentioned to me, even after I asked if he has any kids)... Red flag

He then told me he still lives with his baby mama/ex and has no near plan of them living apart. Oh and they still live in his parents basement... Extreme red flag

He then randomly started talking about how much he hates the left wing because it doesn't favor white men like himself. And then proceeded to talk about how immigrants ruined this country (mind you... I'm middle Eastern and my parents are immigrants lol)... Definitely red flag

We talked about traveling and very nonchalantly he says " you probably have to leave so much earlier to the airport because of security eh?" I asked what he meant and no word of a lie he goes "you know... 9/11. Gotta be extra safe you know?" - backhanded lowkey racism type of red flag.

At that point the red flags turned into checkered flags telling to me to end it and leave. So without any further responses from me, I grabbed my coat, thanked him for the free meal and walked out 😊😊
Guy had a huge, gorgeous house in a very exclusive neighborhood and bragged that his ex wife and 5-year old son lived in a small RV.
He locked me in his apartment and I had to fight my way out.
I came back from the toilet and she was on a dating app swiping left and right. I ended the date v quickly
He opened the first conversation with "the problem with dating is men simp too much for women..."
Then went on a rant about how nobody should buy flowers for women because they just see it at weakness. 
Essentially he was trying to tell me he wouldn't put any effort into the relationship because he shouldn't have to. 
He was also 10 years older than me ...such a shame could've been a typical Reddit age gap story.
I remember I went out on two dates with a girl when I was in my late 30's. She didn't ask me anything during both dates. She's very expressive and loves to talk. Even during texts she'll send hilarious memes and emojis that matches our conversation. But during dates, she won't ask me a thing about me. Loves talking about herself. Not even, "how are you? or how was your day? or how was work?" Sure enough, when I said I didn't want to pursue her and that we should just keep it as friends, she blew up at me and called me all sorts of names, "you're a fucking loser! you're a loser!" and started cursing at me saying, "You asshole I deserve better than you."

I remember just looking at her stunned. Girl had some serious internal issues. I told her that she deserved someone better than me because I for sure would not be able to handle what just happened. I told her she was overreacting because she's not losing anything but that she would have an opportunity to meet someone else. She then started blaming me for things I've never done. LOL. Like, "you're selfish, you only think about yourself! You never think about me! It's always about what you want to do!" I told her, "you're talking to me like we were dating each other for 2 years! We only knew each other for 2 weeks!" I kindly told her we were done. Then she started to apologize and tried to have me stay and that we should just start over. I told her, "no thank you. Really, please don't do this to your next date(s). Just take it easy because you might push away a good man." Then she started to sob. And I walked away. 

Oh boy. I felt sorry for her considering that she seemed like she had some emotional hurt that wasn't resolved from her previous relationship(s). We didn't even have sex and I'm glad we didn't.
She was a court recorder and transcribed our dinner conversation.
If a guy's an hour late it's time to pack up, clearly he doesn't value you or your time.
He told me that his last gf had dumped him cause she was ‘claiming’ he had raped her. 

He told me not to worry, she’s just crazy.
