title: You’re fiancé is much wealthier than you and won’t marry you unless you sign a prenup, what do you do?
Sign the prenup.
Sign the prenup. Make sure to protect both of yourselves in a fair and reasonable manner. Its not a slight against you its just protection for you both. If they hold it over your head even as little as once per year leave..
Sign it.I f was considerable wealthier than my husband before we got married. We each hired our own lawyer and had a prenup drafted. It is just an extray layer of protection in case of divorce. We have insurance for every possible event why not for divorce?.
Have a good lawyer review the prenup.
Read the prenup? Maybe its pretty good and says more than if we break up bye bye now..
Easily sign it. I see the prenup as a document thats mostly about the divorce not the marriage.If were happily ever after greatIf we end up divorced we already knew where the chips would fall and we would have less to fight aboutEdit Of course Id read it discuss it if necessary check with an attourney or whatever to guarantee both me and my partner would have a clear understanding of the agreement. The prenup allows us both to decide whats fair in the hypothetical but statistically feasible divorce.
Some people would say if youre planning to stay together forever because youre truly in love then what does it matter if you sign some paper beforehand. I have a Will in the event I am crushed to death by a forklift so that my kids have a chance. But Im also not planning on that either. So I dont see the difference between the two..
If it was fair Id sign it..
Sign the prenup. Im planning on doing one anyways. As a son of 2 parents who constantly fight i want it to be easy if I need to leave the relationship for my own wellbeing or the wellbeing of my children..
Sign a prenup I mean why not?.
Sign the prenup?.
Depends what it actually says but if its reasonableId sign it..
