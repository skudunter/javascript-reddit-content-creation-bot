title: What film made you say: "Holy shit, there is still 50 minutes left"?
Pearl HarborTheres the climactic attack on Pearl Harbor. Its explosive and tragic. So many people getting hurt and killed. And then ... the movie slows down. And keeps going. For another hour. UGH..
Battlefield Earth.
Titanic when you put that second tape in the VCR.
Artificial Intelligence.
The Irishman 3.5 hour run time was a little long for one sitting..
Titanic. Back in the 90s where VHS was still a thing Titanic the movie was split between two VHS tapes. The first being all about the onboarding and love story while the second finally was about the iceberg hit and sinking after spending what felt like another hour on the love story. Ive always doze off before the second VHS tape got entered where my family stop playing part one and just go straight to part two whenever we decided to watch to movie after that point..
