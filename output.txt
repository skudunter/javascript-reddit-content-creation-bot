title: How would you react if your partner posted nudes online?
I had a girlfriend 6 years ago we usually used to send pictures to each other but she loved to send me provocative pictures. The fact is that once she made a mistake and posted it on her stories. You can possibly think it wasnt a mistake. Her mother called me because one cousin of her saw the picture and she thought i was forcing her to post it. Everything went wrong from there.
OP is trying to figure out how to tell their new SO that they post nudes.
Probably heavily advisor her to take them down since shes 17Edit Im 17 too
Unless its from some sexual escapade we both agreed to Id feel hurt and would probably break it off
Depends on whose nudes she posted.Edit Huh. Never know what random wisecrack is going to take off. Thanks for the awards
His nudes  Up to him.  My nudes  MURDER
I hope youre getting paid for those
That would be pretty crazy if air posted nudes
Shocked. You cant get a pic from a vampire
If it was for outside validation Id have a problem with it
That would be a deal breaker for me.
There are worse things than being a hand model.
