title: What kink has a right to be shamed?
Anything that hurts others without permission.
Crush fetishes. If you need to kill an animal to come youre a total piece of shit.Edit I should have been more specific. There are other forms of crush fetishes that are relatively harmless  but Im solely focusing on the animal crush fetish..
anything involving ChildrenAnimals or the dead deserves to be shamed and treated for mental disorder..
Necrophilia.
Doing shit in front of unwilling spectators like public where minors might see people in the throws of activities and such. Easy way to go to jail probably too.
Degradation kinks I mean theyre literally asking for it.
Anything that involves unwilling participants andor exploitation.
Whatever kink it is that makes people repost this question everyday..
Bug chasers.
Animals like literally why? Does their fur turns them on????.
Asking continuous kink questions on rAskReddit.
